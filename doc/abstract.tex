In this paper we consider a resource allocation
game with limited capacities over large scale networks and
propose a novel randomized algorithm for searching its purestrategy
Nash equilibrium points. It is known that such games
always admit a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium and benefit
from having a low price of anarchy. However, the best
theoretical results only provide a quasi-polynomial constant
approximation algorithm of the equilibrium points over general
networks. Here, we search the state space of the resource
allocation game for its equilibrium points. We use a random
tree based search methods to minimize a proper objective
function and direct the search toward the pure-strategy Nash
equilibrium points of the system. Through empirical results, we
demonstrate that in comparison to the best known theoretical
bounds, our technique is more efficient.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have studied the binary-preference capacitated selfish replication (CSR) game over general networks. We have characterized the equilibrium points of the system using a proper objective function. We leveraged this objective function and proposed a randomized algorithm based on the random tree search to find the global maximizers of this function, and hence, the NE points of the system. As an avenue for future research, one possibility is to study the dynamic version of the $CSR$ game, in the spirit of what has been discussed in \cite{fabrikant2003network}.
